# Release Notes v2.1.1 (Nature of Concern Persistence Hotfix)

Date: 2025-09-17

## Summary
Hotfix release addressing disappearing "Nature of Concern" (Office Concern Types) associations when editing offices, and making concern selection optional during office creation.

## Key Changes
- Prevent data loss: Editing an office without submitting concern checkboxes no longer removes existing `office_concern_types` rows.
- Optional concerns on creation: Offices can now be created without any initial concern types.
- Added server-side validation for required office fields (name, description).
- Added regression script `scripts/regression_office_concerns_test.py` to verify concern persistence logic.
- Updated UI copy in `add_office.html` to reflect optional nature of concern types.
- Version string bumped to `v2.1.1` in `templates/student/student_base.html`.

## Technical Detail
### Root Cause
The previous edit handler (`edit_office`) always interpreted an empty `concern_types` list as intent to remove all associationsâ€”leading to accidental deletion when a simplified edit form (without concern fields) was submitted.

### Fix Approach
Introduced conditional association update: only modify concern links if at least one `concern_types` field is present in the POST payload. Otherwise, existing associations are preserved.

### Modified Files
- `app/admin/routes/edit_office.py`
- `app/admin/routes/add_office.py`
- `templates/admin/add_office.html`
- `templates/student/student_base.html`
- `scripts/regression_office_concerns_test.py` (new)

## Database / Migration Impact
No schema changes. Data safety improved; no migration required.

## Backward Compatibility
Fully backward compatible. Existing offices retain concern associations. Office creation flow now permits zero concerns (previous behavior still works if concerns are selected).

## Testing
1. Created office without selecting concerns: success.
2. Added concern later via office concern management: persisted.
3. Edited office basic info (no concern fields posted): associations remained.
4. Ran regression script: PASS case confirmed.

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert files listed above to previous commit.
2. (Optional) Re-run regression script to confirm restoration of previous behavior.

## Recommended Post-Deploy Checks
- Create a new office without concerns and confirm no errors.
- Add a concern type via the office concern management UI.
- Edit the office name only; ensure concern remains.
- Create inquiry selecting that concern to validate downstream logic.

## Related Risk Mitigations
- Guard added to regression script to avoid running in production if `ENV=production`.
