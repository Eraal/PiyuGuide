## MAIN FEATURE ##

Inquiry System with Websocket Realtime Communication
Counseling with WebRTC and Websocket (LAN-Only Mode supported)

## OFFLINE / LAN-ONLY MODE ##

This system is configured to work completely offline on a local network (LAN).
All resources (CSS, JS, fonts) are served locally - no internet required.

# Video Call / Counseling (LAN-Only)
By default, LAN_ONLY_MODE=True in config.py
- Video calls work when devices are connected to the same router/hotspot
- No external STUN/TURN servers needed
- Both camera and microphone access work on local network
- To enable internet-based calls, set LAN_ONLY_MODE=False and configure TURN servers

# To disable LAN-only mode (requires internet):
Set environment variable: LAN_ONLY_MODE=False
Then configure TURN servers:
- TURN_HOST=your-turn-server.com
- TURN_USERNAME=your-username
- TURN_PASSWORD=your-password
